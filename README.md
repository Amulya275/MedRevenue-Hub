End-to-End Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management Solution- Data Pipeline Implementation

Tech Stack:

Azure Data Factory | Azure Databricks | SQL | Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) | Azure Key Vault | Delta Lake

In MedRevenue Hub project, I designed and implemented a scalable and high-performance data pipeline leveraging Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Databricks to enhance operational efficiency and financial oversight. The solution utilized Delta Lake for optimized data storage, ensuring ACID-compliant transactions and efficient data processing, which enabled real-time insights into key financial metrics, including billing, claims processing, and patient financial data.

To ensure secure and compliant data handling, the pipeline integrated Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) for scalable and structured data storage, while Azure Key Vault was employed for credential management and access control, aligning with HIPAA and other healthcare data regulations. Complex data transformations were performed using SQL, allowing for data standardization, enrichment, and aggregation to generate actionable insights.

This end-to-end cloud-based solution improved the accuracy and accessibility of revenue cycle analytics, enabling healthcare providers to optimize financial performance, reduce claim denials, and enhance decision-making processes. The architecture was designed to support scalability, high availability, and real-time data processing, ensuring that stakeholders could access up-to-date financial insights for informed strategic planning.
